# Memory Management (oss) Application

Memory Management (oss) application by Brett Huffman for CMP SCI 4760 - Project 6 - V1.0

In this project, 

A log was kept of each day's activity.  It is found at the end of this README file.

A Git repository was maintained with a public remote found here: https://github.com/dicer2000/MemoryManagement.git

## Assumptions
There were some items I didn't understand about the project's operation.  Based on the feedback I did receive, I made these assumptions:

1. All times are processed and shown in Seconds:Nanoseconds
2. 

## Program Switches
The program can be invoked as:

```
oss [-h] 
oss [-v]
  -h Describe how the project should be run, then terminate.
  -v puts the logfile output into Verbose Mode
```

## Install

it saved.

```
## Compile
To compile the master application, simply run the make command:
```

```
## Run
To run the program, use the oss command.  You can use any of the command line options listed in program switches area.

## Problems / Issues

The biggest problems experienced in this project was in just understanding what this project was trying to do.  It took me reading and re-reading the instructions many times.  Finally, it became clear, but it was a push.
