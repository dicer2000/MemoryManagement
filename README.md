# Memory Management (oss) Application

Memory Management (oss) application by Brett Huffman for CMP SCI 4760 - Project 6 - V1.0

In this project, 

A log was kept of each day's activity.  It is found at the end of this README file.

A Git repository was maintained with a public remote found here: https://github.com/dicer2000/MemoryManagement.git

## Assumptions
There were some items I didn't understand about the project's operation.  Based on the feedback I did receive, I made these assumptions:

1. All times are processed and shown in Seconds:Nanoseconds
2. The pages are being kept as an array of structs (called PageTable).  This simulates 32 1k pages.  I'm using these structs instead of byte arrays per instruction by Jared Diehl in 4/28 and 4/29 meetings.
3. I implemented FIFO Second Chance Page Replacement Algorithm per the instructions and per Jared Diehl's instruction on 4/29.  This includes running the algorithm from the user_process, setting up reclaimable, and swapping when page faulting.  Please see OSS and User_Proc for implementation details (Especially user_proc.cpp lines 201-239)

## Program Switches
The program can be invoked as:

```
oss [-h] 
oss [-v]
  -h Describe how the project should be run, then terminate.
  -v puts the logfile output into Verbose Mode
```

## Install
To install this program, clone it with git to the folder to which you want 
it saved.
```
git clone https://github.com/dicer2000/MemoryManagement.git
```
## Compile
To compile the master application, simply run the make command:
```
make
```
## Run
To run the program, use the oss command.  You can use any of the command line options listed in program switches area.

## Problems / Issues

The biggest problems experienced in this project was in just understanding what this project was trying to do.  It took me reading and re-reading the instructions many times.  Finally, it became clear, but it was a push.

It seems there are many ways to interpret this project.  This code is the result of my interpretation and study with Jared Diehl.  Please see the assumptions above for key decisions made in the project.

I ended up using structures to define each process' PCB.  All aspects of a frame were built into structures rather than into a tightly-composed bit structure.  I decided to take this approach after consulting with Jared Diehl in 4/28 and 4/29.

## Conclusion

The instructions wanted me to write a little on performance of the page replacement algorithm.  This was pretty easy to do as I didn't implement the replacement algorithm until last.  So, I had been staring at the statistics for some time.

Once I implemented the FIFO 2nd Chance Page Replacement Algorithm, my statistics seemed to jump considerably.  Number of memory accesses per second increased by several accesses and the Number of page faults per memory access decreased.  Finally, the Avg Memory Access Speed increased by 1Kbps. It definitely had an affect on memory allocation performance.
