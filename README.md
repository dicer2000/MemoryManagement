# Resource Management (oss) Application

Resource Management (oss) application by Brett Huffman for CMP SCI 4760 - Project 5 - V1.0

A log was kept of each day's activity.  It is found at the end of this README file.

A Git repository was maintained with a public remote found here: https://github.com/dicer2000/ResourceManagement.git

## Assumptions
There were some items I didn't understand about the project's operation.  Based on the feedback I did receive, I made these assumptions:

2.

```

  -l f Specify a particular name for the log file
```
